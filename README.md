# Daniel Crean Portfolio. 

This is my personal portfolio website built on an hybrid platform consisting of Python 3 using Flask to run as an API endpoint service with the front end to be serviced on React. 

## Run Python API app


In the project directory (daniel-crean-portfolio/server), you can run:

flask run

This should run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/

You should also be able to see different portfolio content on api endpoints e.g.:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/skills

/api/about
/api/skills
/api/portfolio
/api/contact
/api/github
/api/time

All portfolio API end points are sourced from an custom made JSON file sourced in: https://github.com/creandaniel/daniel-crean-portfolio/blob/main/server/website.json



# React App

This is work in progress.
